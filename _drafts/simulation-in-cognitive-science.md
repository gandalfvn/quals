Low-level simulations (not cognitively penetrable):

* motor theory of speech perception
* representational momentum & displacement
* motor control and trajectory planning
* mirror neurons (?)

Mid-level simulations (normally we are unaware of them, but we *might* be if we focus attention on them):

* visual imagery in language understanding (tested with the Perky effect)
* fictive motion
* physical prediction
* theory of mind
* judgments of force/effort

High-level simulations (that involve a clear deliberative component):

* mental model theory
* qualitative simulation
* imagination of episodic events
* imagery (visual, auditory, motor, etc.)
* thought experiments & conceptual simulation
