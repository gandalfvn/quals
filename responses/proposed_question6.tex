\question{How does use of simulation in computer science and robotics relate to the use of simulation in cognitive science? Are there ways in which simulation is used in robotics and computer science that could be applicable to cognitive modeling? Be sure to discuss multiple types of simulation, including probabilistic simulation, simulations in planning (e.g. Monte-Carlo Tree Search), physical simulation for computer graphics, and combinations thereof.}
