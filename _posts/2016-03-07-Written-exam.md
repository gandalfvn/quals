Here are my responses for my written qualifying exam, which I took on January
18th, 2016. I can't promise they are all that coherent (6-8 pages per topic in 9
hours means a *lot* of writing and not much time for editing!) but I figured I
should post them anyway.

1. What are probabilistic models of cognition? Please begin by situating them
   with respect to alternatives (i.e., what are non-probabilistic models of
   cognition?). Then describe what you see as the two or three key strengths of
   this approach, illustrating each with examples.

2. What is the relationship between simulation and probabilistic models of
   cognition? Specifically, one interpretation is that simulations might be
   thought of as samples from a probability distribution. Does this
   interpretation work for all the ways in which simulation has been used to
   explain cognition? Discuss why or why not.

3. How does use of simulation in computer science and robotics relate to the use
   of simulation in cognitive science? Are there ways in which simulation is
   used in robotics and computer science that could be applicable to cognitive
   modeling? Be sure to discuss multiple types of simulation, including
   probabilistic simulation, simulations in planning (e.g. Monte-Carlo Tree
   Search), physical simulation for computer graphics, and combinations thereof.
