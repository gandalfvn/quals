This is an entire book, and as such, I am not going to use the same structure for this post as I have been using. Instead, I'll have a separate section per chapter and give a brief summary for each chapter.

# Chapter 1

Norman, D. (1983). Some Observations on Mental Models. 7--14.

Norman distinguishes between a few different types of models/systems:

1. *Target system* -- the actual system under consideration
2. *Conceptual model* -- a model of the target system as construed by an expert (e.g. an educator)
3. *Mental model* -- a model of the target system as constructed mentally by individuals attempting to reason about it
4. *Scientist's conceptualization* -- a model of someone's mental model, constructed by a scientist trying to understand the mental model

He also discusses the fact that mental models are messy, and won't be describable by "precise, elegant models". He gives as example the behavior people exhibit when learning to use a calculator, such as when they attempt to clear the register multiple times. I actually wonder if that type of behavior could be described by a MDP where there is some probability that when you press the clear button, it doesn't fully clear (reflecting motor noise, for example).
