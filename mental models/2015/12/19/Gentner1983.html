  <article class="post-content">
    <p><span id="Gentner1983">Gentner, D., &amp; Stevens, A. (Eds.). (1983). <i>Mental Models</i>. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Retrieved from http://amzn.com/0898592429</span></p>

<p>This is an entire book, and as such, I am not going to use the same structure for this post as I have been using. Instead, I’ll have a separate section per chapter and give a brief summary for each chapter.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h1>

<p>Norman, D. (1983). Some Observations on Mental Models. 7–14.</p>

<p>Norman distinguishes between a few different types of models/systems:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Target system</em> – the actual system under consideration</li>
  <li><em>Conceptual model</em> – a model of the target system as construed by an expert (e.g. an educator)</li>
  <li><em>Mental model</em> – a model of the target system as constructed mentally by individuals attempting to reason about it</li>
  <li><em>Scientist’s conceptualization</em> – a model of someone’s mental model, constructed by a scientist trying to understand the mental model</li>
</ol>

<p>He also discusses the fact that mental models are messy, and won’t be describable by “precise, elegant models”. He gives as example the behavior people exhibit when learning to use a calculator, such as when they attempt to clear the register multiple times. I actually wonder if that type of behavior could be described by a MDP where there is some probability that when you press the clear button, it doesn’t fully clear (reflecting motor noise, for example).</p>

<h1 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h1>

<p>diSessa, A. (1983). Phenomenology and the Evolution of Intuition. 15–33.</p>

<p>diSessa discusses what kinds of concepts novices have, how and when they use them, and how they come to be replaced by higher-order concepts by experts. He introduces the notion of a “p-prim”, short for <em>phenomenological primitive</em>, which seems to be something like a core concept in a mental model which originally exists on an intuitive level and may eventually be replaced by higher-order concepts and knowledge as a student gains more expertise in a topic. P-prims are used according to two notions of priority: <em>cuing priority</em> and <em>reliability priority</em>. The cuing priority is essentially a heuristic about “how likely the idea is to be profitable”. The reliability priority is essentially a heuristic about how relevent the idea is to the current situation.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a ball is dropped, it picks up speed and hence kinetic energy. When the ball hits the floor, however, it stops (before bouncing upward again). At that instant, there is no kinetic energy since there is no motion. Where did the energy go?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To answer this question, people will rely on p-prims such as “rigidity” and “springiness”. For an expert, “rigidity” has a lower cuing priority than “springiness”, and thus they will be less likely to rely on rigidity as an explanation, whereas a novice might use rigidity. An expert has different notions of how reliable “springiness” is to the problem (e.g. seeing a bouncing ball as springy) than a novice would.</p>
